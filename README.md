Building Data-Driven Restaurant Success Using **Zomato** Market Insights

This repository contains my submission for **The Manhattan Project** – Strategic EDA Case, focused on leveraging Zomato’s restaurant dataset to design a high-ROI business strategy for a new HoReCa startup.

**Our mission:** decode the Indian food service ecosystem through data — identifying what to sell, where to launch, and how to scale profitably — using real-world restaurant patterns in pricing, ratings, cuisines, and delivery behavior.

🔍 Project Overview
---
This project transforms raw Zomato data into actionable strategy blueprints for a HoReCa entrepreneur.
It combines exploratory data analysis with business logic to answer three core questions:

Where to Launch: Which cities and localities offer the best mix of demand, pricing, and rating stability?

What to Serve: Which cuisines and price bands maximize popularity, votes, and margins?

How to Scale: What operational and marketing levers sustain growth and profitability over time?

📈 Key Strategic Recommendations
---
**🍽️ 1. Market Positioning & Pricing Focus**

Target mid-range pricing (₹199–₹299) — the most competitive and high-volume band.

Avoid ultra-premium pricing unless paired with experiential or brand-led differentiation.

Positive: Large, stable customer base; strong price–rating correlation.

Negative: Requires operational efficiency to sustain margins.

**🌆 2. City & Locality Launch Strategy**

Begin in Hyderabad, Jaipur, Kolkata, and Bangalore — cities with strong mid-price, high-rating clusters.

Focus on high-performing localities like Abids, Egmore, Charminar, Ulsoor for early traction.

Positive: Dense demand and high aggregator visibility.

Negative: High local competition — must differentiate through quality and speed.

**🚚 3. Delivery-First Operating Model**

Build a delivery-first dark kitchen model; median delivery votes show untapped demand.

Optimize speed, packaging, and aggregator promotions for early rating lift.

Positive: High scalability and lower fixed costs.

Negative: Heavy dependence on aggregator margins.

**🍴 4. Menu & Cuisine Strategy**

Launch with 10–15 hero SKUs: biryani, fried rice, paneer mains, desserts, and beverages.

Add signature premium (Turkish, Bakery, Seafood) items for upsell once traction builds.

Positive: Simplifies ops, channels demand efficiently.

Negative: Risk of limited variety perception initially.

**💬 5. Social Proof & Engagement Engine**

Run a vote velocity plan — use bundles, sampling, and review nudges to cross 50→150→300 votes.

Tag hero items as BESTSELLER / MUST TRY for discovery boost.

Positive: Drives aggregator ranking and visibility.

Negative: Requires short-term promo investment.

**💸 6. Value & Rating Optimization**

Engineer low Price_per_Vote (PPV) through combo pricing and portion control.

Maintain blended rating ≥4.2 to stay above the market median.

Positive: Creates sustained traction and retention.

Negative: Tight QA needed to maintain rating consistency.

**🧩 7. Category Sequencing**

Phase 1: Kolkata – Fast Food + Beverages

Phase 2: Kochi – Desserts | Chennai – Fast Food

Phase 3: Mumbai – Chinese | Jaipur – Desserts | Bangalore – Multi-brand hub

Positive: Phased rollout reduces risk, captures proven demand.

Negative: Slower national expansion pace.

**📊 8. Growth & Channel Strategy**

Delivery-first cities: Pune, Raipur, Mumbai

Hybrid cities: Jaipur, Chennai, Kolkata

Focus marketing on delivery-friendly cuisines: Desserts, Beverages, Fast Food

Positive: Aligns channel with cuisine elasticity.

Negative: Dine-in experience may lag initially.

**🌟 9. Brand & Experience Focus**

Maintain ≥4.2 rating moat through fast fulfilment, clean packaging, and consistent taste.

Build a “value-premium” brand voice — quality at a fair price.

Positive: Improves NPS, retention, and discoverability.

Negative: Higher operational discipline required.

**💼 10. Financial & Operational Efficiency**

Keep 70–80% of SKUs in value/mid-tier; 20–30% premium for ARPU.

Use bundles to raise margins instead of price hikes.

Positive: Balanced cost–value equation.

Negative: Requires close cost monitoring.

🧭 Vision Forward
---
Channel Synergy: Start delivery-first, evolve into dine-in and cloud collaborations once brand traction builds.

Smart Scaling: Expand through data-led hotspot mapping and localized category focus.

Sustained Differentiation: Combine rating excellence + value + operational efficiency for compounding growth.
